                        href="https://fairventures.org/en/">Fairventures</a>
                    The navigation bar is simple and the hover effect is also good in this webpage.
                    The arrangement of the logo to the left, nav titles in the middle and the buttons at the
                    far right is managed and clean to see. Hence, this was taken as a first reference.
                    However, during hover a round yellow mouse pointer appears in the fairventure's website.
                    This part isn't implemented in our website navigation bar.

                    The second picture inserted below displays the nav bar of our website.
                    In accordance with the reference webpage, the logo is inserted to the far left,
                    then there are five navigation titles named Home, Blog, Products,Research and about Us.
                    At the right there are two different buttons named Log In and Sign up. There are certain
                    unique changes in terms of the reference and the webpage navigation bar as we have
                    changed the color, font styles and the color of border bottom on hover.
                    The reason for considering this navigation bar is that the hover effect, arrangement
                    of items all look standard, although simple but clean and managed.

                    the left side of the page by creating a side division. The main feature of the blog
                    inserted in this webpage is that it contains series of images and texts arranged in a
                    simple but easy to read and understandable manner. This helped us picture that the blog must
                    have enough content but arranged in a clean manner with image inserted wherever necessary.
                    We found this blog designed, written and arranged in a creative manner.

                    inserted and images somewhere. Our blog doesn't contain the contents only adjusted to the
                    left hand side, instead on the center of the page. Also, the impacts of technology are added in
                    two separate divisions placed side by side to each other. Hence, by taking the reference,
                    incorporating certain properties of it and adding certain unique changes, the blog part was made.

                    something to refer to from this webpage.
